## Overview

Christoffel's Menu Management App is a digital menu manager designed for Chef Christoffel's private chef services. It streamlines menu creation and management, provides quick statistics (counts and average prices), and offers an intuitive mobile experience for adding and organizing dishes.

This repository is implemented in TypeScript (100%) and uses Expo + React Native for the mobile frontend and Supabase for persistence.

## Features

Core Functionality
- Menu Management: Add, view, and remove menu items.
- Course Categories: Organize dishes into Starter, Main, and Dessert.
- Real-time Statistics: View total items and average price (overall and per course).
- Advanced Filtering: Filter menu items by course type (All / Starter / Main / Dessert).
- Persistent Storage: Menu data stored in Supabase.
- Sample Data: One‑time "Add Samples" button to populate demo items.

User Experience
- Intuitive Navigation: Bottom tab navigation to access Menu, Add, and Filter screens.
- Pull-to-Refresh: Manual sync to refresh menu data.
- Confirmation Dialogs: Prevent accidental deletions.
- Form Validation: Immediate validation with helpful error messages.
- Empty & Loading States: Clear feedback when no items or while loading.

Technical Highlights
- TypeScript: End-to-end type safety.
- React Context: Centralized menu state management.
- Supabase Integration: Secure backend with Row Level Security (RLS).
- Error Handling: Graceful error messages and retry affordances.
- Responsive Design: Optimized for common Android devices.
- Modern UI: Clean, consistent styling with iconography.

Short feature explanations
- Add Item: Fill dish name, description, pick a course and price; form validation prevents invalid entries.
- Remove Item: Tap trash icon on card → confirmation alert → item removed from Supabase and context state.
- Filter: Choose a course to view only that category; item counts update to reflect the filter.
- Statistics: Calculated from the current dataset (cached in context) for immediate feedback.
- Sample Data: Useful for demos and testing; items can be removed individually afterwards.

---

## Future Enhancements (planned)
- Edit existing menu items
- Image upload for dishes

### Learning Outcomes Demonstrated

This project demonstrates the following learning outcomes as per the assignment requirements:
1. Use a for loop in TypeScript to solve programming problems — Implemented in `utils/menuUtils.ts` for iterating through menu items to calculate statistics.
2. Use a while loop in TypeScript to solve programming problems — Demonstrated in validation logic and data processing functions.
3. Use a for in loop in TypeScript to solve programming problems — Used for object property iteration in utility functions.
4. Define a function in TypeScript — Multiple functions defined across components and utilities (e.g., `calculateAveragePrice`, `saveMenuItems`, `loadMenuItems`).
5. Use Global variables — State management using React hooks (useState) for global app state.
6. Use functions to organise code — Code organized into reusable functions in `utils/menuUtils.ts` and `utils/storage.ts`.
